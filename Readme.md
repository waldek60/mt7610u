# Driver For Mediatek MT7610u

This is a mere skeleton of what hopes to be a driver for the MT7610u, using both the upstreamed [MT7601u](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/drivers/net/wireless/mediatek/mt7601u) driver and the vendor-provided [MT7610u](http://www.mediatek.com/en/downloads1/downloads/mt7610u-usb/) drivers as reference.

I am keeping track of progress in a related [project page](https://tristianc.github.io/mt7610u/).
