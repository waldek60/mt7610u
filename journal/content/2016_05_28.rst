:summary: What happens when the device gets probed?

I started editing ``mt7610u_probe()`` in the mainline driver. The equivalent function in the mediatek driver is ``rtusb_probe()`` in ``usb_main_dev.c``. Both the mediatek 7610 driver and the mainlined 7601 driver call ``interface_to_usbdev()`` to get a usb_device. Then, they diverge:

Mainline driver:
================

- Calls ``interface_to_usbdev()`` and produces a ``struct usb_device *``
- Calls ``mt7601u_alloc_device()`` and produces a ``struct mt7601u_dev *``

The function ``mt7601u_alloc_device()`` is defined in ``init.c``.
The ``struct mt7601u_dev`` is defined in ``mt7601u.h``.

Mediatek driver:
================

- Calls ``rt2870_probe()``
